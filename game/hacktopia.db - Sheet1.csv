8,What is Shor's Algorithm,"is a algorthim that factors a prime number efficently. Where, classical computers do not have a algorthim like Shor's algorithm. _______ can be used for things like credit card numbers to crytography.","is a search algorithm that makes search engines faster. It states that if you have N values, you have to search through an average square root of N values. And, for a classical computer, you have to search through N/2 values.",,,2
