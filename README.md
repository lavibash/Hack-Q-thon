## Inspiration
What inspired us was the lack of resources online or just anywhere. There wasn't much information or ways to learn quantum computing, let alone interesting ways to learn it. So we decided to come up with this. 
## What it does
this project has multiple parts. The first part is the game engine. It is a game where you have to defeat a mad scientist by learning about quantum computing and solving pop quizzes. It makes the whole experience memorable and fun. This is a terminal-based game so it could have been better. 

The second part is the recommendation system using unsupervised machine learning. We would implement this into a website in the future with the game to complete the project.
## How we built it
Our tech stack was python and SQLite which we used to store the questions and answers for the game. Although it was mostly python and Machine Learning. We had a lot of fun.
The AI uses collaborative filtering, cosine similarity, and linear kernel. It uses all three to come to a conclusion and suggest the next best course.
## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was making the AI. It was long and difficult but we made it through. Another problem we ran into was configuring invalid input, we solved this by listing all the possible answers. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making the AI work was one of the best parts. However, we couldn't put it up on a website because we were having trouble importing qiskit using python.
## What we learned
We learned AI implementation in a recommendation system. We also learned how to network better and communicate better. 
## What's next for Hacktopia
we are planning to make a website that takes the recommendation system and the game to make a complete project. 
We had a lot of fun doing this project and hope to do it again in the future.
